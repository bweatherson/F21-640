\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This course has two parts. The first part concerns philosophical work on
the nature of thick concepts, and in particular whether the existence of
these thick concepts poses a threat to the idea that there is a
fact/value distinction. The second part of the course concerns
particular thick concepts, with a special focus on those that are
relevant to both ethics and epistemology.

\hypertarget{canvas}{%
\section{Canvas}\label{canvas}}

There is a Canvas site for this course, which can be accessed from
\url{https://canvas.umich.edu}. Course documents (syllabus, lecture
notes, assignments) will be available from this site. Please make sure
that you can access this site. Consult the site regularly for
announcements, including changes to the course schedule. And there are
many tools on the site to communicate with each other, and with me.

\hypertarget{required-materials}{%
\section{Required Materials}\label{required-materials}}

There is one required book for the course.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{The Lewd, the Rude and the Nasty: A Study of Thick Concepts in
  Ethics} by Pekka VÃ¤yrynen. (This will be referred to as LRN in what
  follows.)
\end{itemize}

It's also highly recommended that you get

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy} by Bernard Williams. (This
  will be referred to as ELP in what follows.)
\item
  \emph{Thick Evaluations} by Simon Kirchin - this is freely available
  at
  \url{https://global.oup.com/academic/product/thick-evaluation-9780198803430}.
  (Look for `open access' in top right.)
\end{itemize}

There are some assigned readings from it, but I'll try to make them
available to anyone who doesn't have a copy. But if you're working in
ethics, it's probably one of the books you should have on your shelf
anyway.

The other readings will all be available through the university library,
and will be linked on Canvas.

\hypertarget{course-requirements}{%
\section{Course Requirements}\label{course-requirements}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Participate in the classes each week, having done the reading.
\item
  Write four `weeklies' at some point during the term. A weekly should
  be a 2-3 page paper making one good point (either a criticism, or an
  application to some other debate) about the reading for that week.
  These do not need to include summaries of the text; assume the reader
  knows what you're talking about.
\item
  In every week that you don't write a weekly, leave (at least) one
  question about (at least) one of the papers from the reading on the
  Canvas discussion boards.
\item
  When possible, answer some of the questions on the boards, and
  contribute to discussions there.
\item
  Write one short paper (about 10-12 pages, or about 3000 words) on one
  of the topics we discuss in the course.
\end{enumerate}

The weeklies, and the short paper, may be co-authored. (I don't know
what it would be to co-author a question, though you should give credit
to someone if the question came out of discussions with them.)

\hypertarget{summary-of-grading-system}{%
\section{Summary of Grading System}\label{summary-of-grading-system}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Participation in discussion boards and online classes - 20\%
\item
  Weeklies - 4 by 10\% = 40\%
\item
  Short paper - 40\%
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{plagiarism}{%
\section{Plagiarism}\label{plagiarism}}

Although team-work, and even co-authorship, is encouraged, plagiarism is
strictly prohibited. You are responsible for making sure that none of
your work is plagiarized. Be sure to cite work that you use, both direct
quotations and paraphrased ideas. Any citation method that is tolerably
clear is permitted, but if you'd like a good description of a citation
scheme that works well in philosophy, look at
\url{http://bit.ly/VDhRJ4}.

You are encouraged to discuss the course material, including
assignments, with your classmates, but all written work that you hand in
under your own name must be your own. If work is handed is as the work
of two people, you are affirming that each person did a fair share of
the work. (Note that when you're submitting work on Canvas, you have to
each submit the paper, even if it is co-authored. That way Canvas knows
that everyone has turned in work.)

You should also be familiar with the academic integrity policies of the
College of Literature, Science \& the Arts at the University of
Michigan, which are available here:
\url{http://www.lsa.umich.edu/academicintegrity/}. Violations of these
policies will be reported to the Office of the Assistant Dean for
Student Academic Affairs, and sanctioned with a course grade of F.

\hypertarget{disability}{%
\section{Disability}\label{disability}}

The University of Michigan abides by the Americans with Disabilities Act
of 1990, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and other
applicable federal and state laws that prohibit discrimination on the
basis of disability, which mandate that reasonable accommodations be
provided for qualified students with disabilities.

If you have a disability, and may require some type of instructional
and/or examination accommodation, please contact me early in the
semester. If you have not already done so, you will also need to
register with the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities. The
office is located at G664 Haven Hall.

For more information on disability services at the University of
Michigan, go to \url{http://ssd.umich.edu}.

\newpage

\hypertarget{class-schedule}{%
\section{Class Schedule}\label{class-schedule}}

Students must read the following before Monday's class session.
Important: class readings are subject to change, contingent on
circumstances and the progress we make as a class. Students are
encouraged to attend lectures and check the course website for updates.
The links to readings will often be to things behind paywalls, but they
are (I believe) all things you have access to through the UM library.
You might have to be logged in to UM to get them though.

For each week, we'll go through the readings in the order they are here.
That doesn't mean they are in order of importance; a couple of times
there is a reading I want to focus on, but we need to briefly discuss
something else to set it up. So each week I've starred the one that is
really most crucial, though it might not be stuff we start with. Also,
we'll open each week with an open floor for any questions/comments/etc
about anything on the list. After that I'll work through things in the
order they appear here, with the intent of going in the order shown.

It might not be obvious, but many of the paper titles below contain
links to places the paper is accessible. (In some cases, that includes
places where I have made them accessible, mostly legally.)

Note that because we really aren't expecting everyone to do the
recommended reading, if you want to make a point about something in the
recommended reading, you might need to provide a bit of background to
any comment. (This isn't important for the discussion boards, but it is
important in class.) But you should assume everyone is familiar with the
required readings, especially the starred ones.
